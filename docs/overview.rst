RTP Overview 
============

This project implements a real time platform to deploy the O-CU and O-DU.

This is based on Yocto/OpenEmbedded, so it includes a Yocto/OpenEmbedded compatible
layers meta-oran and wrapper scripts to pull all required Yocto/OE layers to build
out the reference platform.

About Yocto and OpenEmbedded
----------------------------
The Yocto Project is an open source collaboration project that provides templates,
tools and methods to help you create custom Linux-based systems for embedded and
IOT products, regardless of the hardware architecture.

OpenEmbedded is a build automation framework and cross-compile environment used
to create Linux distributions for embedded devices. The OpenEmbedded framework
is developed by the OpenEmbedded community, which was formally established in 2003.
OpenEmbedded is the recommended build system of the Yocto Project, which is a Linux
Foundation workgroup that assists commercial companies in the development of Linux-based
systems for embedded products.
